HEFIN: Decentralized Health and Finance Platform
This repository contains a conceptual proof-of-concept for the HEFIN platform, a decentralized application (dapp) built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The platform aims to provide a secure, user-centric experience for managing health and financial data.

Architecture
The application consists of two main canisters:

hefin_backend: A Motoko canister that acts as the backend, storing and managing user data.

hefin_frontend: An asset canister that serves the web UI (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Note on Database: On the Internet Computer, canisters act as both the application logic and the data store. This project uses Motoko's stable data structures for orthogonal persistence, eliminating the need for an external database like MongoDB and aligning with the principles of decentralization.

Development and Deployment Instructions
Prerequisites
DFINITY Canister SDK: Install dfx by running sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)".

Node.js and npm: Required for managing frontend dependencies.

Local Development
Start a Local Replica: In your project directory, run the command dfx start --background to start a local instance of the ICP blockchain.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the hefin_frontend directory and install the necessary npm packages.

cd hefin_frontend
npm install
cd ..

Build and Deploy: This command builds both the backend and frontend canisters and deploys them to your local replica.

dfx deploy

After a successful deployment, dfx will print the URLs for your local canisters.

Access the Frontend: Open the URL provided for the hefin_frontend canister in your web browser. It will look similar to http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai.

How to Use the App
The frontend UI allows you to:

Set Identity: A placeholder for user authentication. In a real-world app, this would be an Internet Identity login.

Add a Record: Create a new health or financial record, which is stored in the hefin_backend canister.

Get Records: Retrieve and display all records associated with your current identity.

Future Improvements
Internet Identity Integration: Replace the simple identity input with a proper Internet Identity login flow for secure, passwordless authentication.

Encrypted Data: Implement data encryption within the canister to ensure maximum privacy for sensitive health and financial records.

Inter-Canister Communication: Extend the project with multiple canisters (e.g., a separate AI canister for analytics) that can securely communicate with the main backend.

Claims Processing Logic: Add more complex Motoko logic to simulate the automated claims processing and fraud detection described in the project concept
.# HEFIN Backend (Motoko canister + Mongo integration)

## Prereqs
- DFINITY SDK (`dfx`) installed
- Node 18+ and npm
- Docker & docker-compose (for local Mongo + integration service)

## Local canister build & deploy (local replica)
1. Start local replica
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
